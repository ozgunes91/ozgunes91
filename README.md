# Özge Güneş — Data Analyst (Python) | Automation | BI

Hi — I’m **Özge Güneş**. I’m a **Food Engineer** transitioning into **data analytics and automation**, building end-to-end projects that turn messy data into **clean outputs, dashboards, and repeatable workflows**.

I care about **clarity, reproducibility, and business usefulness** (not buzzwords).

---

## What I do
- **Data analysis & EDA:** cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, insights
- **Automation:** Python scripts that replace manual Excel/reporting routines
- **Forecasting & experiments:** time series practice + A/B testing practice projects
- **BI mindset:** build “dashboard-ready” datasets and clear reporting outputs

---

## Featured projects (selected)
> These are **practice / sample projects** designed to simulate real-world tasks.

- **HTML Table Scraper + Excel Export + Gmail Delivery (Automation)**
  - Repo: `html-table-scraper-gmail-automation`
  - What it shows: scraping → cleaning → Excel export → automated emailing with secure env vars

- **Medical Invoice Comparison Tool (Reconciliation & Matching)**
  - Repo: `medical-invoice-comparison-tool`
  - What it shows: PDF/Excel parsing, normalization, fuzzy matching, mismatch detection

- **Food Nutrition Intelligence (Streamlit Dashboard)**
  - Repo: `food-nutrition-intelligence`
  - What it shows: EDA + ML practice (e.g., calorie prediction), clustering (KMeans + PCA), simple recommender workflow

- **Coca-Cola Time Series Analysis (Prophet Forecast)**
  - Repo: `Coca-Cola-Time-Series-Analysis-Prophet-Forecast-Project`
  - What it shows: time series exploration + Prophet-based forecasting practice and reporting

- **Shelf Life Prediction (Food domain ML practice)**
  - Repo: `shelf_life_prediction`
  - What it shows: regression framing, feature handling, evaluation and experimentation

- **Ecolense Intelligence (Sustainability dashboard - ongoing / exploratory)**
  - Repo: `ecolense-intelligence`
  - What it shows: dashboard/product thinking around waste & sustainability analytics

## Toolbox 
**Core**
- Python (pandas, NumPy), Jupyter/Colab, Git/GitHub
- Data cleaning, EDA, visualization (matplotlib)

**Working knowledge / improving**
- SQL (writing queries for analysis & reporting — actively improving)
- scikit-learn (classic ML workflows), time series practice (Prophet)
- Streamlit (building simple analytics apps)
- Power BI (reporting & BI workflows)

**Learning now**
- R / RStudio fundamentals (in progress)
- Better SQL + analytics engineering habits (clean models, reusable datasets)

---

## Certifications & training
- **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** (completed)
- **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** (completed)
- **MiUUL Data Scientist Bootcamp (200+ hrs)** (completed)
- **Coursera Python 3 Programming Specialization (University of Michigan)** (completed)

---

## How I work
- I keep projects **reproducible** (clear README, requirements, step-by-step runs)
- I prefer **simple > fragile** (clean code, transparent assumptions)
- I document decisions so others can **review and reuse** the work
